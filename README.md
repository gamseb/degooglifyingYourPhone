# How to  get rid of google on your phone 

1. Install LineageOS without openGapps
2. Install F-Droid
3. Customise the system and get all the apps



# Why installing a custom ROM? 

There are two reasons: privacy and security. As we all know, big companies like google keep syphoning our personal data to sell them to third parties. Also they aresusceptible to cyber attacks, social engineering attacks and police warrants. Bottom line is, that they are not to be trusted with our  private lives. 
The secon reason is, that many devices have stopped getting updates even though the hardware is still good and usable. When using an older device with outdated security patches we open ourselves to many problems and become very easy targets for ill intentioned individuals. With a custom ROM we can limit or even mitigate most of these problems. 

For private custom Android ROMs there are two main options:

* [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/)
* [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org) 

I personally don't have any experience with GrapheneOS, so I am going to only talk about LineageOS. I have plenty of experience with the Nexus 5x model, but I will be soon upgrading to one of the older Google Pixels. I know it is ironic, but the google phones are the best to de-google.

# Installing lineage os

There two main ways to install LineageOS on your device. Either you download premade binaries or you can compile them from the source, which is a bit harder. 

1. [Find a supported device](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/)
2. Either [download the installation](https://download.lineageos.org/) files for the device or compile them from source
3. BACK UP ALL THE FILES FROM THE DEVICE and make sure the device is charged enough
4. Proceed with the installation 
   * The instructions are usually pretty clear so I am not going to go into details here
5. If you want to have a phone without google then do NOT install OpenGapps
6. You should have a working phone without google now



# Applications and alternatives

A phone without google can seem useless at first. With the right applications it can be as usefull as a stock Android, but without all the tracking. It always depends on what you need from a phone. 

The first step is always to install [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) 

# [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) 

F-Droid is an alternative to the google store with a twist. Everything is free of cost and also most apps are open source. There is a very thorough community oversight and all applications are checked for trackers and malware. You can find there some applications, that are not present on the google store. 

To install it go to the https://f-droid.org website -> Download the .apk file -> install it on the phone (check yes to all the security popups)



# [Aurora store](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.store/)

Aurora store is another store, that allows to download applications from google play without logging in or getting tracked. It works as a proxy between you and google. 



# [New pipe](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/)

New pipe is a youtube alternative, that can only be found on F-Droid. No tracking, background playing, small window mode, video downloading, playlists, etc. It has all the good stuff of the paid version of Youtube and more. 



# [Shelter](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.typeblog.shelter/)

Shelter allows to isolate applications into their own sandbox to limit tracking and battery usage. Pretty good when you just NEED to have that app installed but you don't really trust it. (Looking at you WhattsApp)



# [Frost for Facebook](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.pitchedapps.frost/)

In a perfect world we could all ditch Facebook and let it die. This is not a perfect world, so I at least try to limit what Facebook can do on my phone. Also this application is much much smaller than the official one. It also allows for customisation.



# [Tinfoil for Twitter](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.mill_e.twitterwrapper/)

Similar to Frost for Facebook. Allows you to use Twitter without being spyed or losing too much functionality.
